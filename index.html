              I did the Chakra Journey with Devi in Koh Phangan in July 2018 and had an amazing journey. This course was just a
              wonderful way to review myself and my life to get a better understanding of why some things are the way they are. It is
              a beautiful journey (but also uncomfortable sometimes when I had interesting realizations) and I warmly recommend it for
              anyone who is interested in Kundalini and/or personal development. I have done another retreat with Devi before and also
              taken drop-in classes with her. She is a truly special person who is dedicated to her path, to sharing her knowledge and
              to help people grow and develop. I highly recommend spending time with her!!

              I have the best experience possible, I never imagined myself engaging and enjoying the Kundalini Yoga practice. Really.
              
              But Devi has such a great energy that's is impossible to not engage deeply into the practice. For you that is beginner or expert, you can check on his work with close eyes, she kindly give a lot of options to do the positions.
              
              I couldn't recommend more.. Come and get into a true and deep Kundalini Yoga experience.

              Devi is a true inspiration who shares her wisdom from the heart. Her own healing journey allows her authentic truth to shine so brightly and be integrated deeply. Devi's passion and power is what magnetises me back to her classes and courses time and time again. My first chakra journey was in India last year and I have just completed my 2nd journey online which was equally incredible. You will experience deep transformation and realisations during each journey. This is for the brave, the lion hearted and the inspired. I have learned more with each chakra journey then many many books I've read and everything about it resonated so strongly with me. I have also purchased the online radiant woman course which I am excited to start soon. I have recommended Devi to many friends and family who have also had magical experiences and I am so grateful to have found such a powerful light bearer. THANK YOU DEVI!

              One of the best decisions I've made so far this year was to take the Chakra Journey course with Devi. We spent each day focused on a different chakra, going in depth, and exploring each of them through Kundalini Yoga. Devi spoke from a place of wisdom and personal experience that anchored the entire journey together. I highly recommend the Chakra Journey (or any Kundalini Yoga class) with Devi. It's not about the knowledge you'll gain, but the experience you'll have.

              easy to get lost and feel victimised by our own insecurities, reconnecting to the light and innate power is crucial. My
              experience in the Immersion course has been exactly that. Rekindling my self love through the process of doing the
              kriyas and allowing myself to re recognize and stand by my truths.
              
              Devi is a beautiful being and the light she brings each of us back to within ourselves is going to change the world.
              Once we remember how we create our life, our body and this planet every day, we can begin breathe the nourishment and
              sustenance we have been searching for. That is paradise on Earth:)

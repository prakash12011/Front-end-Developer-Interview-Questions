            teachers and
            techniques that have supported my journey. One of the most profound was studying and
            practicing for 7 years with the Brahma Kumaris World Spiritual University. I opened a centre to offer teachings in the

            I did the Chakra Journey with Devi in Koh Phangan in July 2018 and had an amazing journey. This course was just a
            wonderful way to review myself and my life to get a better understanding of why some things are the way they are. It is
            a beautiful journey (but also uncomfortable sometimes when I had interesting realizations) and I warmly recommend it for
            anyone who is interested in Kundalini and/or personal development. I have done another retreat with Devi before and also
            taken drop-in classes with her. She is a truly special person who is dedicated to her path, to sharing her knowledge and
            to help people grow and develop. I highly recommend spending time with her!!

            Then specific kriyas, meditations and timelines set to get you started. This will vary

                <strong>My name is Devi Kaur</strong>, I have been practicing and studying yoga for over 20 years, and have
                experienced many inspiring teachers and
                techniques that have supported my journey.

                One of the most profound was studying and
                practicing for 7 years with the Brahma Kumaris World Spiritual University. I opened a centre to
                offer teachings in the north of England, serving
                many in the community with this powerful and
                beautiful philosophy.

                continued for about one year, which led me to do some research, and like a bolt of lightening Kundalini Yoga came loud
                and clear into my reality, which then propelled me into training with Golden Bridge in
                Rishikesh, India. I soon started to travel and teach around the world, sharing the experiences that I had gained as well

          For me yoga is not just a fitness exercise or a practice I do only on the mat. It is a way of life, a way to live, to
          love and experience union with the Divine and the essence of who I am. Kundalini Yoga has been one of the most powerful
          tools for my own transformation and evolution. It is with great honor and respect that I can share this ancient
          technology that has enabled me to transform deep past childhood trauma into my greatest gift.</p>

          I have also been deeply inspired by the teachings of Anodea Judith, Caroline Myss &
          Rebecca Campbell especially with healing the feminine. I feel so blessed to offer powerful Kundalini
          Workshops & Courses with specific Kriyas and Meditations for Women to re-connect to the Mother, Earth, Moon, Shakti,
          Priestess, Medicine Woman, Healer, for Women to discover their Feminine Sacred Power, and have the courage to navigate

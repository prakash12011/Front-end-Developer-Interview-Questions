                <strong>My name is Devi Kaur</strong>, I have been practicing and studying yoga for over 20 years, and have
                experienced many inspiring teachers and
                techniques that have supported my journey.
              </p>
              <p class="section-description">
                One of the most profound experiences was practicing/studying with the Brahma Kumaris for seven years. Opening a centre
                in the north of England, serving many in the community with this beautiful philosophy, as well as offering other healing
                modalities such as yoga and massage.
              </p>
              <p class="section-description">
                In 2012 my journey with the Brahma Kumaris had reached its potential. I am forever grateful for the teachings, the
                healing and the most important relationship and realistation ever experienced - God and Me, Me and God are One!
              </p>
              <p class="section-description">
                After leaving this powerful path I was led into the next chapter of my life and Kundalini did not just knock at my door
                it completely blew it up! Past traumas came to be recognised and healed as I entered my first Conscious Sacred
                Relationship. Healing the Feminine and Masculine within me, a profound and deep journey began to unfold. I soon found
                myself in Rishikesh, India, Kundalini Training with Golden Bridge and then travelling mainly in Asia and India sharing
                one of the most powerful medicines on the planet - Kundalini Yoga. To this day I am so honored to teach this quantum
                technology, which nurtures and nourishes my entire physical body and soul and my unique relationship with Great Spirit &
                Mother Earth.

          For me yoga is not just a fitness exercise or a practice I do only on the mat. It is a way of life, a way to live, to
          love and experience union with the Divine and the essence of who I am. Kundalini Yoga has been one of the most powerful
          tools for my own transformation and evolution. It is with great honor and respect that I can share this ancient
          technology that has enabled me to transform deep past childhood trauma into my greatest gift.</p>
          <p class="section-description">
          I have also been deeply inspired by the teachings of Anodea Judith, Caroline Myss &
          Rebecca Campbell especially with healing the feminine. I feel so blessed to offer powerful Kundalini
          Workshops & Courses with specific Kriyas and Meditations for Women to re-connect to the Mother, Earth, Moon, Shakti,
          Priestess, Medicine Woman, Healer, for Women to discover their Feminine Sacred Power, and have the courage to navigate
          and cultivate their unique medicine gift which is so much needed on the planet now</p>
